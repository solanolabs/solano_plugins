# Custom Software Installation

To alleviate the need to install additional software, Solano workers already have many common software packages installed,
including many popular versions. Since not all software packages (and versions) can be pre-installed, we have included some examples
of installing custom software (or versions) here. If you would like a particular package (or version) to be pre-installed on Solano
workers, please contact support@solanolabs.com.

- [Yarn](./yarn) Install the latest version of Yarn Node package manager.
- [Docker](./docker) Install the latest version of Docker community edition and Docker Compose.
- [Chrome](./chrome) Install a specific version of Chrome browser.

Some software packages are not easily compatible with Solano CI's default Ubuntu 12 based worker volume.
[Custom Worker Volumes](https://docs.solanolabs.com/Beta/custom-worker-volumes/) may need to be enabled/activated.
