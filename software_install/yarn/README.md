# Latest Yarn Version

The example [solano.yml](./solano.yml) demonstrates checking if a minimum version of [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
is installed and available. If not, the latest version of `yarn` will be installed. The version comparison and
installation logic could be altered to install a specific version (instead of the latest version).
